<h1> <mark> WHAT IS HTML </h1>
<h2> HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.
The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later tutorial. For now,
we will focus on teaching you how to build rather than design.</h2>
<h1> <mark> HISTORY OF HTML </h1>
<h2>HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989. It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to another document altogether. The latest
version is known as HTML5.A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and presented. To do this HTML
uses two things: tags and attributes.
